		<h2>Accessibility statement</h2>

		<p>This accessibility statement is valid for the website www.cpacs.de.</p>
		
		<p>As a public sector body of the German Federal Government within the 
		meaning of EU Directive 2016/2102, we endeavour to make our websites and
		 mobile applications accessible in accordance with the provisions set 
		out in the German Equality for Persons with Disabilities Act (BGG) and 
		the German Barrier-Free Information Technology Ordinance (BITV 2.0) in 
		order to implement EU Directive 2016/2102.</p>
		
		<h3>Compliance status</h3>
		
		<p>The accessibility requirements stem from Sections 3 (1) to (4) and 4 of BITV 2.0, adopted on the basis of Section 12d BGG.</p>
		
		<p>At present, the website is partially compliant with the aforementioned requirements. 
		The website is currently being reviewed with regard to accessibility. It is therefore 
		possible that not all accessibility requirements have been fully met. We
		are working on addressing all identified accessibility problems.</p>
		
		<h3>Preparation of this accessibility statement</h3>

		<h3>Conciliation procedure</h3>
		
		<p>If no satisfactory solution is found following your feedback, then 
		you can turn to the conciliation body, pursuant to Section 16 BGG. The 
		BGG conciliation body is tasked with helping to settle 
		accessibility-related disputes out of court between people with 
		disabilities and federal public bodies. The conciliation procedure is
