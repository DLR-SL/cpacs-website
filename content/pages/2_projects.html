                <h5>2014 - 2017</h5>
                    As fourth in a series of projects focused on building up a design environment for the collaborative and distributed analysis of aircraft configurations within DLR, the <i>Future Enhanced Aircraft Configurations</i> (FrEACs) focused on applying the established tools and methodologies to the design of non-conventional aircraft configurations. Within an automatic simulation workflow spanning multiple levels of analysis fidelity, the potential of a strut-braced wing configuration as future short- to medium-range aircraft was successfully investigated. Furthermore, the flight mechanical and handling qualities of a blended-wing-body configuration were investigated and tested within DLR's AVES flight simulator. During the project, the team progressively built up and utilized CPACS-based workflows for both configurations including over <b>24 analysis modules</b> from <b>11 different DLR institutes</b>. The introduction of design camps - special meetings focused on conducting a specific task, e.g. the downselection of possible design concepts - proved to be a very useful addition to the design process within the project. During the final design camps, the built-up simulation workflow spanning multi fidelity levels was utilized to perform designs of experiments. Focus during these design camps was on comparing results on the three involved fidelity levels and collaborative result interpretation, in which combining the knowledge of all participating team members is of invaluable importance.

                <h3>ATLAs</h3>
                <h5>2017 - 2019</h5>
                    Within the <i>Advanced Technology Long-range Aircraft Concepts</i> (ATLAs) project, which was successfully completed in December 2019, CPACS served as common language in a collaborative aircraft design project involving <b>13 DLR institutes</b>. In ATLAs, advanced assessment procedures were employed to evaluate the impact of modern technologies, such as hybrid laminar flow control or a CO2 management system for cabins - on future aircraft configurations in a more holistic way. The underlying use-case for these studies is the design of an advanced mid-range aircraft. The various disciplines and technologies underline the importance of not only considering the aircraft itself, but also modeling operational aspects in CPACS, e.g. to assess the climate impact of new designs. Within the ATLAs project, the parametric logic of CPACS has proved to be an enabler for performing technology evaluation studies combining multiple promising technologies in a single configuration.
