			<p><strong>Liability</strong></p>

			<p>According to section 7 first paragraph of the German Telemedia Act,
				DLR as the content provider is responsible for its own content which it
				provides for use on this website https://dlr-sc.github.io/tigl/,
				in accordance with the general laws. Cross-references ("links") to
				content provided by other content providers must be distinguished from
				DLR's own content. By means of the cross-reference DLR provides
				third-party content for use which is marked accordingly by the
				indication "[external]" or by a link. Before setting the link DLR checks
				this third-party content if it causes possible civil or criminal
				liability. However, it cannot be excluded that the third-party content
				providers change their content afterwards. DLR does not constantly check
				the third-party content it refers to for changes made by the
				third-party content providers which could engender DLR's civil or
				criminal liability. If you believe that the linked external sites
				violate applicable laws or otherwise have inappropriate content, please
				let us know.</p>
