	<p><strong>Liability for DLR´s own content</strong></p>

	<p>As far as DLR´s "own content" (information, software or documentation) is being made available free of
		charge on this website www.cpacs.de, any
		liability for defects as to quality or title of DLR´s own content- especially in relation to the
		correctness or absence of defects or the absence of claims or third party rights or in relation to
		completeness and/or fitness for purpose - is excluded except in cases of willful misconduct or gross
		negligence</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>Liability for third party content via setting of hyperlinks</strong></p>

	<p>Cross-references or rather hyperlinks ("links") to content provided by other content providers must be
		distinguished from DLR´s own content. By means of hyperlinking DLR provides third-party content for use
		which is marked accordingly by the indication "[external]" or by a link. Before setting the link DLR
		checks this third-party content if it causes possible civil or criminal liability. However, it cannot be
		excluded that the third-party content providers change their content afterwards. DLR does not constantly
		check the third-party content it refers to for changes made by the third-party content providers which
		could engender DLR´s civil or criminal liability. If you believe that the linked external sites violate
		applicable laws or otherwise have inappropriate content, please let us know.</p>
