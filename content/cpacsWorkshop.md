CPACS is a key technology for collaboration across large multidisciplinary design teams and for interoperation within complex projects. This “language” is currently used to define a standardised data structure for the air transportation system, and its development was initiated by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) 20 years ago. On this special occasion, DLR in Hamburg invites researchers and engineers from industry, research organisations, academia and think-tanks to join and:

- get **exciting insights** into both, the **history and current developments of CPACS** and the connected [TiGL geometry software](https://dlr-sc.github.io/tigl/)
- receive **hands-on tutorials** and support during **practical exercises**
- have **great networking opportunities** and **gain new inspiration**

If multidisciplinary design-optimisation is at the core of your work – come and **join us on 1-2 October 2025 at the [ZAL](https://zal.aero/en/) in Hamburg**. We will soon provide a registration link.
