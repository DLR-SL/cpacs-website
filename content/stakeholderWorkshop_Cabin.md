On May 31, CPACS developers and users met on a virtual stakeholder meeting to discuss a revision of the CPACS decks definition and floor structures. An already very mature proposal from the cabin department of the DLR Institute of System Architectures in Aeronautics served as a basis (see [#674](https://github.com/DLR-SL/CPACS/issues/674)). In addition, current problems with the parameterization of doors were discussed and initial ideas were exchanged to resolve these in the future. All further activities will take place on [GitHub](https://github.com/DLR-SL/CPACS/issues) until further notice. So it's worth taking a regular look at the [issue list](https://github.com/DLR-SL/CPACS/issues).
