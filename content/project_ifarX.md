CPACS is used as a key technology in the "[IFAR](https://www.ifar.aero/)-X Challenge". Young engineers and scientists from over 20 countries collaborate in developing a multi-disciplinary aircraft design process with the common goal of integrating green technologies in future aircraft. 

A first meeting took place from Aug. 29 to Sept. 1 in Moscow, hosted by the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute named after N.E. Zhukovsky ([TsAGI](http://tsagi.com)). During a three-day seminar, both the basics of CPACS, openAD and RCE were explored and a collaborative design process â€“ incorporating the expertise of the various specialists involved - was initiated.

In this context, a visit to the International Aviation and Space Salon (MAKS-2019) was a must. In addition to admiring a great flight show in Moscow, the participants of the challenge have gotten to know each other very well.
