To celebrate the 20th anniversary of CPACS, we are inviting researchers and engineers from industry, small-and medium-sized companies, research organisations, academia and think-tanks to join our event to: 

- get **exciting insights** into both, the **history and current developments of CPACS** and the connected [TiGL geometry software](https://dlr-sc.github.io/tigl/)
- receive **hands-on tutorials** and support during **practical exercises**
- have **great networking opportunities** and **gain new inspiration**

A **pre-workshop for CPACS-newbies** like students and young professionals will take place in the morning, offering in-depth hands-on experience of a digital engineering process using the CPACS Design System. This includes the CPACS data model, TiGL, and the Remote Component Environment (RCE).

If multidisciplinary design-optimisation is at the core of your work â€“ come and **join us on 1-2 October 2025 at the [ZAL](https://zal.aero/en/) in Hamburg**: [**Register now**](https://dlr.expert/20-years-of-cpacs)!
