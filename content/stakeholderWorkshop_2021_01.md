Over the past months, the CPACS community has been working on [numerous enhancements](https://www.cpacs.de/towards-cpacs-33.html) to advance the common language for aircraft design to its next version. After combining the results of the individual working groups into a [beta release](https://www.cpacs.de/cpacs-33-beta.html), we would now like to continue the [release process](https://github.com/DLR-SL/CPACS/blob/develop/development/development.md) and kindly invite you to two topic-specific stakeholder meetings to: 
1) introduce and discuss the planned enhancements and modifications and 
2) to decide whether the developments are ready for creating the official release candidate for CPACS v3.3.

**When**: 20.01.2021; 13:00-17:00 and 11.02.2021; 09:00-13:00

**Where**: Web-meeting
