An increasing amount of aircraft design projects focuses on sustainable and green aviation enabled by advanced system architectures. To reflect the needs of the required data exchange within these projects, an appropriate system parametrization in CPACS needs to be developed. For this purpose we would like to invite experts in aircraft system design and overall aircraft design to an online workshop, in which we get to know each other’s projects and targets through short presentations, to find synergies in current activities and to draw a roadmap towards the establishment of a common ontology for aircraft systems. 

**When**: 13 May 2020; 13:30 – 17:30

**Where**: web-meeting

**Details**: [CPACS Workshop Invitation](http://cpacs.de/CPACS_Workshop_Invitation.pdf)

I'm looking forward to your registration as presenter or interested attendee,

Marko
